## üöÄ Getting Started

### Project Structure

The project is neatly divided into two main components:

- **`flask-backend`**: The server-side application responsible for handling file uploads, PII detection, and redaction.
- **`sih`**: The client-side React application offering an intuitive interface for users to interact with the PII redaction features.
- **`pii-redactor-tool`**: The python package comprising of the scripts running to achieve the functionalities of the project.
  
### Frontend (React)

The frontend provides a modern, dynamic user experience with:

- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making smooth HTTP requests to the backend.
- **React Icons**: A set of icons to enhance the UI, including download and spinner icons.
- **React Router DOM**: For seamless navigation between pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.

### Backend (Flask)

The backend handles the heavy lifting with:

- **Flask**: The web framework powering the API.
- **Flask-CORS**: To handle cross-origin requests.
- **Werkzeug**: Utility functions for secure file handling.
- **PyMuPDF**: For processing PDF documents.
- **pytesseract**: To perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **OpenCV**: For advanced image manipulation.
- **google-generativeai**: To detect PII using the Gemini API.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data processing.
- **FuzzyWuzzy**: For fuzzy matching of text.

### npm Package

To streamline integration into your workflow, `redactCrew` also offers an npm package. This package provides a simple API for integrating PII detection and redaction features into your own projects. You can install and use the package with: 

```bash
npm i sih_package
```

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashwant1810/redactCrew.git
   cd redactCrew
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

   Navigate to the `flask-backend` directory and install the Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd flask-backend
   pip3 install flask flask-cors werkzeug PyMuPDF pytesseract Pillow opencv-python google-generativeai numpy fuzzywuzzy
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `flask-backend` directory for your environment variables.

3. **Frontend Setup**:

   Move to the `sih` directory and install the necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   cd ../sih
   npm install react axios react-icons react-router-dom tailwindcss
   ```

4. **Running the Application**:

   - **Start the Flask Backend**:

     ```bash
     cd flask-backend
     python3 app.py
     ```

   - **Start the React Frontend**:

     ```bash
     cd ../sih
     npm start
     ```

   Your React app will be live at `http://localhost:3000`, and the Flask API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop or select a file to upload through the React interface.
2. **Configure**: Choose the types of PII you want to detect and redact.
3. **Download**: Receive and download the redacted file once processing is complete.
